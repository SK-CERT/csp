# Alpha Installer

This installer is based on the "bashinator" framework at http://www.bashinator.org/
To install, follow these steps:

* Make sure you're root
* Extract all files in a directory (e.g. /tmp/install)
* Execute install-cspinst.sh (in that folder) as root.
* "cspinst.sh" is then going to be available in the system path
